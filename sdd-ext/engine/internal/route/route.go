// Package route implements kez's deterministic implementation-route advisor.
// Each turn it recommends the *smallest useful* route for the work — do it
// inline, delegate a narrow slice, or continue the active SDD proposal — and
// injects the rule into the system prompt so route selection stops being an
// implicit guess.
//
// The load-bearing rule, adapted from gentle-ai's organic routing: size, file
// count, and perceived risk NEVER select SDD on their own. SDD is durable
// planning state; it is entered only by an explicit human request or an already
// accepted proposal, never because a change "looks big".
